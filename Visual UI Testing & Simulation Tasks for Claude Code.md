```

## Execution Order & Dependencies

**Prerequisites:** Tasks 1-5 (Core validation system) must be completed first

**Sequence:**

1. **Task 6** → Foundation (required for all others)
2. **Tasks 7, 8** → Core testing capabilities
3. **Tasks 9, 10** → Advanced analysis and automation
4. **Tasks 11, 12** → Real-time and accessibility
5. **Task 13** → Integration and orchestration
6. **Tasks 14, 15, 16** → Development workflow and advanced features

## Package.json Integration

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:visual": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/ui-simulator.ts",
    "test:regression": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/visual-regression.ts",
    "test:journeys": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/user-journey.ts",
    "test:a11y": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/accessibility-tester.ts",
    "monitor:ui": "tsx scripts/validation/runtime/ui-monitor.ts",
    "validate:ui-complete": "tsx scripts/validation/core/visual-validation-runner.ts",
    "test:visual:watch": "tsx scripts/validation/dev/watch-mode.ts",
    "debug:ui-state": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/ui-serializer.ts --claude-format",
    "debug:component": "tsx scripts/validation/dev/component-debugger.ts",
    "update:baselines": "tsx scripts/validation/visual/visual-regression.ts --update-baselines"
  }
}
```

These tasks will create a comprehensive visual testing system that bridges the gap between what you see in the browser and what Claude Code can analyze, providing detailed visual state information for debugging and validation
