# Phase 1 Baseline Documentation

## Current Project State - Pre-Phase 1 Fixes

### 1. Theme System Status

**Current State of `applyThemeToDocument` Function:**
- Function exists in `/src/config/theme.ts`
- **STATUS: NEVER CALLED** - The function is defined but not invoked anywhere in the application
- Theme switching is non-functional due to this missing integration

### 2. Hardcoded Color Values

**Audit Results:**
Based on the code review, the following hardcoded colors were identified:

#### Vite Default Colors (Still Present):
- `#646cff` - Purple primary (Vite default)
- `#535bf2` - Purple hover (Vite default)
- `#242424` - Dark background (Vite default)
- `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87)` - Text color (Vite default)

#### Other Hardcoded Colors Found:
- `#0a0f1a` - Background color in multiple components
- `#00ffff` - Cyan accent used directly instead of theme variable
- `#00bcd4` - Primary cyan
- `#00e5ff` - Info color
- Various rgba values for glass effects

**Total Count:** 20+ hardcoded hex values across the codebase

### 3. Bundle Sizes (Current)

To be measured after running build commands...

### 4. Performance Metrics Baseline

**Components Missing React.memo:**
- Panel.tsx (281 lines)
- DynamicLayout.tsx
- PanelGroup.tsx
- ResizablePanel.tsx
- Most panel components in /src/components/panels/

**Performance Issues Identified:**
- Large component files causing unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization on expensive calculations
- No useCallback on event handlers passed to children

### 5. Environment Variable Setup Status

**Current Issues:**
- No `.env.example` file exists
- Incomplete typing for environment variables in `env.d.ts`
- No runtime validation for environment variables
- Missing documentation for required variables

### 6. Current Build Status

**Health Check Results:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✅ Successfully installed (1088 packages)
   - Had to install `jest-environment-jsdom` separately
   - Removed duplicate jest.config.js file

2. **Test Suite**: ❌ Failing
   - Jest configuration issues with ES modules (nanoid)
   - Multiple TypeScript errors in test files
   - Tests currently not running successfully

3. **Build Status**: ❌ Failing
   - TypeScript compilation errors (200+ errors)
   - Many unused variables and type mismatches
   - Missing imports in several files
   - Issues with exact optional property types

4. **Development Server**: ✅ Running
   - Dev server starts successfully on port 5173
   - Basic HTML loads correctly
   - Application appears to be accessible

### 7. Current TypeScript Issues Summary

**Most Common Issues:**
1. Unused variables (TS6133) - 50+ occurrences
2. Missing imports (TS2304) - PanelComponent, WorkspaceConfig, etc.
3. Type mismatches with exactOptionalPropertyTypes
4. Implicit 'any' types
5. Tuple type errors in test files

### 8. Performance Baseline

**Bundle Sizes**: Not measured due to build failures

**Components Confirmed Missing React.memo:**
- Panel.tsx (281 lines)
- DynamicLayout.tsx
- PanelGroup.tsx  
- ResizablePanel.tsx
- All panel components in /src/components/panels/

### 9. Summary

The project is in a partially functional state:
- Development server runs
- Many TypeScript errors prevent successful builds
- Test suite is not operational
- Theme system is defined but not integrated (applyThemeToDocument never called)
- Significant technical debt needs to be addressed before implementing Phase 1 fixes
